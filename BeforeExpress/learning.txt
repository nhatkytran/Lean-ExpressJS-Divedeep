+++ HTTP --> TCP / UDP +++

--> Packet
--> There are 5 basic layers in the structure of every packet
+ Application layer --> HTTP, FTP --> Data --> Chunk
+ Transport layer --> TCP/UDP --> data segments, datagrams --> create Packet (wired + wireless)
+ Network layer --> IP --> Packet
+ Data Link layer --> Ethernet, Wifi --> Frame (wired)
+ Physical layer --> Cables

--> Packet consists header, payload, layers,...

--> Physical layer --> Information about communication medium: cables,...

--> Data Link layer --> Responsible for maintaining the link between the two devices \
sending and receiving the packet
--> Wired networks, Data Link layer refers to Ethernet
+ Ethernet is a set of standards for transmitting data over a physical link,...
--> Wireless networks, Data Link layer refers to Wifi

*** Point to note
--> Application --> Data, chunk
--> Transport --> Segment (dest: port,...)
--> Network --> Packet (IP Address)
--> Data Link --> Frame (MAC address)
--> Physical

HTTP uses TCP because TCP is reliable (for example we need data transmitted in order)

+++ How the Internet works - TCP and UDP +++

TCP connection
HTTP Request -->
<-- HTTP Response

--> After each HTTP request --> the HTTP connection closes, so does the TCP connection
--> The main way to keep the TCP connection open is Websockets (socket.io)

--> HTTP --> HTML, images, mp4,...
+ Efficient --> HTTP is only connected when required
+ Stateless --> No dialogue

--> HTTP message --> Start line + Header + Body
